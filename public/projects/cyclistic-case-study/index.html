  "articleBody": "In this case study, I analyze historical data from a Chicago based bike-share company in order to identify trends in how their customers use bikes differently. The main tools I use are spreadsheets, SQL and Tableau. Here are the highlights:\nTableau Dashboard: Cyclistic Bikeshare in Chicago\nSlides: Where Rubber Meets Road in Converting Casual Riders to Cyclistic Members\nGitHub: Cyclistic Case Study Repository\nA more in-depth breakdown of the case study scenario is included below, followed by my full report.\nScenario Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago with two types of customers. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are known as casual riders, while those who purchase annual memberships are known as members. Cyclistic’s financial analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.\nThe marketing analytics team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. The primary stakeholders for this project include Cyclistic’s director of marketing and the Cyclistic executive team. The Cyclistic marketing analytics team are secondary stakeholders.\nDefining the problem The main problem for the director of marketing and marketing analytics team is this: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting Cyclistic’s casual riders into annual members. There are three questions that will guide this future marketing program. For my scope on this project, I will anlyze the first question:\n1) How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n2) Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?\n3) How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?\nBy looking at the data, we will be able to first get a broad sense of certain patterns that are occurring in the two different groups. Understanding the differences will provide more accurate customer profiles for each group. These insights will help the marketing analytics team design high quality targeted marketing for converting casual riders into members. For the Cyclistic executive team, these insights will help Cyclistic maximize the number of annual members and will fuel future growth for the company.\nBusiness task Analyze historical bike trip data to identify trends in how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. Data sources We’ll be using Cyclistic’s historical bike trip data from the last 12 months, which is publicly available here. The data is made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license. The data is stored in spreadsheets. There are 12 .CSV files total:\n01) 2021-02_divvy_trip-data.csv 02) 2021-03_divvy_trip-data.csv 03) 2021-04_divvy_trip-data.csv 04) 2021-05_divvy_trip-data.csv 05) 2021-06_divvy_trip-data.csv 06) 2021-07_divvy_trip-data.csv 07) 2021-08_divvy_trip-data.csv 08) 2021-09_divvy_trip-data.csv 09) 2021-10_divvy_trip-data.csv 10) 2021-11_divvy_trip-data.csv 11) 2021-12_divvy_trip-data.csv 12) 2022-01_divvy_trip-data.csv It is structured data, organized in rows (records) and columns (fields). Each record represents one trip, and each trip has a unique field that identifies it: ride_id. Each trip is anonymized and includes the following fields:\n* ride_id #Ride id - unique * rideable_type #Bike type - Classic, Docked, Electric * started_at #Trip start day and time * ended_at #Trip end day and time * start_station_name #Trip start station * start_station_id #Trip start station id * end_station_name #Trip end station * end_station_id #Trip end station id * start_lat #Trip start latitude * start_lng #Trip start longitute * end_lat #Trip end latitude * end_lat #Trip end longitute * member_casual #Rider type - Member or Casual Bike station data that is made publicly available by the city of Chicago will also be used. It can be downloaded here. In terms of bias and credibility, both data sources we are using ROCCC:\nReliable and original: this is public data that contains accurate, complete and unbiased info on Cyclistic’s historical bike trips. It can be used to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes.\nComprehensive and current: these sources contain all the data needed to understand the different ways members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes. The data is from the past 12 months. It is current and relevant to the task at hand. This is important because the usefulness of data decreases as time passes.\n**Cited:**these sources are publicly available data provided by Cyclistic and the City of Chicago. Governmental agency data and vetted public data are typically good sources of data.\nData cleaning and manipulation Microsoft Excel: initial data cleaning and manipulation Our next step is making sure the data is stored appropriately and prepared for analysis. After downloading all 12 zip files and unzipping them, I housed the files in a temporary folder on my desktop. I also created subfolders for the .CSV files and the .XLS files so that I have a copy of the original data. Then, I launched Excel, opened each file, and chose to Save As an Excel Workbook file. For each .XLS file, I did the following:\nChanged format of started_at and ended_at columns\nFormatted as custom DATETIME Format \u003e Cells \u003e Custom \u003e yyyy-mm-dd h:mm:ss Created a column called ride_length\nCalculated the length of each ride by subtracting the column started_at from the column ended_at (example: =D2-C2) Formatted as TIME Format \u003e Cells \u003e Time \u003e HH:MM:SS (37:30:55) Created a column called ride_date\nCalculated the date of each ride started using the DATE command (example: =DATE(YEAR(C2),MONTH(C2),DAY(C2))) Format \u003e Cells \u003e Date \u003e YYYY-MM-DD Created a column called ride_month\nEntered the month of each ride and formatted as number (example: January: =1) Format \u003e Cells \u003e Number Created a column called ride_year\nEntered the year of each ride and formatted as general Format \u003e Cells \u003e General \u003e YYYY Created a column called start_time\nCalculated the start time of each ride using the started_at column Formatted as TIME Format \u003e Cells \u003e Time \u003e HH:MM:SS (37:30:55) Created a column called end_time\nCalculated the end time of each ride using the ended_at column Formatted as TIME Format \u003e Cells \u003e Time \u003e HH:MM:SS (37:30:55) Created a column called day_of_week\nCalculated the day of the week that each ride started using the WEEKDAY command (example: =WEEKDAY(C2,1)) Formatted as a NUMBER with no decimals Format \u003e Cells \u003e Number (no decimals) \u003e 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 Note: 1 = Sunday and 7 = Saturday After making these updates, I saved each .XLS file as a new .CSV file.\nBigQuery: further data cleaning and manipulation via SQL Since these datasets are so large, it makes sense to move our analysis to a tool that is better suited for handling large datasets. I chose to use SQL via BigQuery.\nIn order to continue processing the data in BigQuery, I created a bucket in Google Cloud Storage to upload all 12 files. I then created a project in BigQuery and uploaded these files as datasets. I’ve provided my initial cleaning and transformation SQL queries here for reference: initial_setup_query.sql\nThe results from the COUNT DISTINCT query for each table are very interesting. We can see that the three summer months have the highest trip counts, followed by alternating spring and fall months before ending with winter months:\nCreate quarterly tables In order to perform analysis by season, let’s combine these tables. We’ll create Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 tables for analysis. We’ll have two Q1 tables– one for 20221 and one for 2022 – since we have FEB/MAR data from 2021 and JAN data from 2022:\nTable 1) 2021_Q1 -\u003e FEB(02), MAR(03) Table 2) 2021_Q2 -\u003e APR(04), MAY(05), JUN(06) Table 3) 2021_Q3 -\u003e JUL(07), AUG(08), SEP(09) Table 4) 2021_Q4 -\u003e OCT(10), NOV(11), DEC(12) Table 5) 2022_Q1 -\u003e JAN(01) We’ll first create 2021_Q2 and then repeat for the remaining four tables:\nClean and transform day of week Some additional data cleaning is needed on the new table. First, we’ll update the format for day_of_week from FLOAT to STRING. Then, we’ll change the values from numbers to their corresponding day names (i.e. 1 = Sunday, 7 = Saturday. We’ll start with 2021_Q1 and repeat for the remaining four tables:\nDelete old tables Now that we have our tables organized into quarters, we can delete the original monthly tables from BigQuery. We no longer need the monthly tables since the data is available in the quarter tables. Also, it costs money to store these datasets in BigQuery.\nAnalysis #1: Exploratory 2021_Q1 - quarterly data exploration We’ll select a few columns from 2021_Q1 to preview in a temporary table. This will help give us an idea of potential trends and relationships to explore further:\nThe above query returned 278,119 rows. That is the number of recorded trips we have data for in this quarter. Let’s dive deeper into those trip totals.\nTotal trips We’ll create total columns for overall, annual members and casual riders. We’ll also calculate percentages of overall total for both types:\nOf the 278,118 total trips in 2021_Q1, 66% were from annual members while 34% were from casual riders.\nAverage ride lengths How does average ride_length differ for these groups?\nWe can see that casual riders average about 23 more minutes per ride. That seems like a pretty big difference. What influence are outliers having on these averages? Let’s investigate.\nMax ride lengths We’ll look at the maximum values for ride_length to see if anything extreme is influencing the casual rider average:\nAs we suspected, the casual riders average ride_length was significantly impacted by at least one outlier. The longest trip duration for casual riders was 528 hours, or 22 days. Meanwhile, the longest for annual was about 26 hours.\nLet’s take a look at the top 100 highest ride_length values for casual riders to confirm there is more than one outlier affecting the average:\nMedian ride lengths Since there are more than a few outliers impacting the average, we’re going to use median instead of average. Median will be more accurate for our analysis:\nNow we see a much closer number, with 18 minutes for casual riders and 10 minutes for annual members.\nBusiest day for rides Let’s see which day has the most rides for annual members and casual riders:\nUnsurprisingly, Saturday is the most popular day for both annual members and casual riders.\nMedian ride length per day Let’s look at the median ride lengths per day for both annual members and casual riders. Since Saturday is the most popular overall, do we think it will also have the highest median ride length?\nVery interesting! The median ride length for casual riders on the top five days (SUN, SAT, MON, TUE, WED) is nearly double the amount for annual members on their top five days (SAT, SUN, MON, TUE, WED).\nTotal rides per day Let’s look at total rides per day. We’ll create columns for overall total, annual members and casual riders:\nStart stations Next, we’ll look at the most popular start stations for trips. We’ll again include columns for overall, annual member and casual rider totals per start station:\nWe can begin to see some interesting patterns in the start station data. It looks like casual riders and annual members tend to favor different regions for beginning their trips. By updating the ORDER BY function to sort by casual DESC and member DESC in two separate queries, we can compare the top ten start stations for both:\nWow! There is only one start station that cracks the top ten for both lists.\nThe Clark St \u0026 Elm St start station is ranked #1 for annual members and #10 for casual riders. The casual riders seem to favor stations near the water like Lake Shore Dr \u0026 Monroe St and Streeter Dr \u0026 Grand Ave, while annual members frequent start stations in the River North neighborhood like Dearborn St \u0026 Erie St and Kingsbury St \u0026 Kinzie St.\nAn initial hypothesis for casual riders could be that they tend to favor start stations near the water and close to tourist attractions because they use bikes for weekend entertainment. An initial hypothesis for annual members could be that they tend to favor start stations in downtown, retail areas because they are using bikes for their work commutes and shopping trips.\nQuarterly data exploration (cont.) Instead of walking through each quarter like we’ve done for 2021_Q1, I will instead provide links to the full SQL files. The queries used are similar to the ones above:\nanalysis_2021_Q1.sql analysis_2021_Q2.sql analysis_2021_Q3.sql analysis_2021_Q4.sql analysis_2022_Q1.sql I’ll included some high-level quarterly analysis notes in the next section.\nAnalysis #2: Summary full_year - trends, relationships and insights In order to analyze all twelve months together, we’ll combine the five quarterly tables into one table. The queries used to accomplish this are included here for reference. I’ve also provided the SQL file used for full year analysis: analysis_full_year.sql.\nFor a summary and overall visualization of my full year analysis, please visit the Tableau Public dashboard I created here: Tableau Dashboard: Cyclistic Bikeshare in Chicago.\nI will also highlight some of the interesting trends and relationships I discovered below.\nAnnual Members vs Casual Riders Seasonal trends Summer vs Winter The busiest time of year for overall bike trips is Q3– July, August and September. This makes sense because these months are mainly summer time. Bike riding is better suited for warmer weather, which is also why we see a major drop-off in total rides during the winter months of Q1– January, February and March.\nAnnual members outnumbered casual riders in every quarter except Q3. Interestingly, the annual members nearly doubled the casual ridership in Q1 and Q4 while only slightly edging them out in Q2.\nMedian ride length We learned in the earlier quarterly analysis that the average ride_length for casual riders was significantly impacted by outliers, so median is a more accurate measurement for our analysis:\nWe can see that casual riders consistently have longer rides than annual members.\nDay of week Which days of the week have the highest number of rides for casual riders vs annual members? Let’s look at the mode for each quarter and for the full year:\nCasual riders were extremely consistent, with Saturday revealing itself as their preferred day of week for each quarter and across the full year. Meanwhile, the annual members looked to favor the middle of the week for their bike use. The most popular day for them acrosss the full year was Wednesday. Let’s see how the total rides for each day stack up for both groups:\nHow about median ride length per day of week for both groups?\nA few fascinating insights from the above chart:\nU-shape pattern\nSunday and Saturday are favored by both groups for longer rides, while ride duration decreases towards the middle of the week before increasing again on Friday. This results in a u-shape trend for both groups in the above chart, although it is much more dramatic for casual riders.\nRange differences\nFor annual members, difference between their longest day and their shortest day is 1 minute and 44 seconds. For casual riders, difference is 4 minute and 57 seconds. That is a 185.58% increase in difference for casual riders.\nAnnual members: day-to-day consistency\nThe annual members may have shorter ride lengths when compared to casual riders, but they are extremely consistent with their bike use day-over-day.\nCasual riders: weekend warriors\nThe daily median ride length for casual riders is consistently higher than that of annual members. The range of their ride length duration varies at a greater amount than that of annual members. Sundays and Saturdays stand out as their longest ride days.\nBike type Do members and casual riders have different preferences for bike type? Are classic bikes more popular than electric bikes?\nWe can see that classic bikes are favored by both groups. Let’s look at the percentages of bike type use within each group:\nLooking at the above, we might ask what exactly is a docked bike and why are only casual riders using them?\nWe can now see from the above charts that docked bikes are the culprit for the outliers affecting our ride length averages from earlier in our analysis. This is something we should discuss with our team further and address.\nStart and end station use In the Tableau Dashboard I created, which is again available here, there is a worksheet that allows the exploration of start and end station use by members, casual riders and combined overall rides. The snapshot below is from the overall view. While interacting with the dashboard, we can see that casual riders have a higher max than annual members. Annual members have a lower max, but we can see more colors represented across the member map versus the consistent coloring across the casual map. This tells us that rides by members are more distributed across stations while rides by casual riders are more top heavy in that a huge chunk are happening at the same few stations.\nConclusion Stakeholder presentation and dashboard I’ve provided links below for my dashboard and shareholder presentation, which includes the following:\nA summary of my analysis Supporting visualizations and key findings Three recommendations based on my analysis Presentation: Where Rubber Meets Road in Converting Casual Riders to Cyclistic Members\nTableau Dashboard: Cyclistic Bikeshare in Chicago\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>In this case study, I analyze historical data from a Chicago based bike-share
company in order to identify trends in how their customers use bikes differently.
The main tools I use are spreadsheets, SQL and Tableau. Here are the highlights:</p>

<h3 id="scenario">Scenario<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#scenario">#</a></h3>
<p>Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago with two types of customers.
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are known as <strong>casual riders</strong>,
while those who purchase annual memberships are known as <strong>members</strong>. Cyclistic’s
financial analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable
than casual riders. The director of marketing believes the company’s future
success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.</p>
<p>The marketing analytics team wants to understand how casual riders and annual
members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the team will
design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
The primary stakeholders for this project include Cyclistic&rsquo;s director of
marketing and the Cyclistic executive team. The Cyclistic marketing analytics
team are secondary stakeholders.</p>

<h2 id="defining-the-problem">Defining the problem<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#defining-the-problem">#</a></h2>
<p>The main problem for the director of marketing and marketing analytics team is
this: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting Cyclistic’s casual riders
into annual members. There are three questions that will guide this future
marketing program. For my scope on this project, I will anlyze the first
question:</p>
<p><em>1) How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?</em><br>
2) Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?<br>
3) How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become
members?</p>
<p>By looking at the data, we will be able to first get a broad sense of certain
patterns that are occurring in the two different groups. Understanding the
differences will provide more accurate customer profiles for each group. These
insights will help the marketing analytics team design high quality targeted
marketing for converting casual riders into members. For the Cyclistic executive
team, these insights will help Cyclistic maximize the number of annual members
and will fuel future growth for the company.</p>

<p>We’ll be using Cyclistic’s historical bike trip data from the last 12 months,
which is publicly available <a href="https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">here</a>.
The data is made available by Motivate International Inc. under this <a href="https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement">license</a>. The data is stored
in spreadsheets. There are 12 .CSV files total:</p>
<pre><code>01) 2021-02_divvy_trip-data.csv  
02) 2021-03_divvy_trip-data.csv

11) 2021-12_divvy_trip-data.csv  
12) 2022-01_divvy_trip-data.csv  
</code></pre>
<p>It is structured data, organized in rows (records) and columns (fields). Each
record represents one trip, and each trip has a unique field that identifies it:
<code>ride_id</code>. Each trip is anonymized and includes the following fields:</p>
<pre><code>* ride_id               #Ride id - unique
* rideable_type         #Bike type - Classic, Docked, Electric
* started_at            #Trip start day and time
* ended_at              #Trip end day and time
* start_station_name    #Trip start station
* start_station_id      #Trip start station id
* end_station_name      #Trip end station
* end_station_id        #Trip end station id
* start_lat             #Trip start latitude  
* start_lng             #Trip start longitute   
* end_lat               #Trip end latitude  
* end_lat               #Trip end longitute   
* member_casual         #Rider type - Member or Casual  
</code></pre>
<p>Bike station data that is made publicly available by the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->city of Chicago<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
will also be used. It can be downloaded <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In terms of bias and credibility, both data sources we are using ROCCC:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reliable and original:</strong> this is public data that contains accurate,
complete and unbiased info on Cyclistic’s historical bike trips. It can be used
to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comprehensive and current:</strong> these sources contain all the data needed to
understand the different ways members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes. The
data is from the past 12 months. It is current and relevant to the task at hand.
This is important because the usefulness of data decreases as time passes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Cited:**these sources are publicly available data provided by Cyclistic and
the City of Chicago. Governmental agency data and vetted public data are
typically good sources of data.</p>

<p>Our next step is making sure the data is stored appropriately and prepared for
analysis. After downloading all 12 zip files and unzipping them, I housed the
files in a temporary folder on my desktop. I also created subfolders for the
.CSV files and the .XLS files so that I have a copy of the original data.
Then, I launched Excel, opened each file, and chose to Save As an Excel Workbook
file. For each .XLS file, I did the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Changed format of <code>started_at</code> and <code>ended_at</code> columns</p>
<ul>
<li>Formatted as custom <code>DATETIME</code></li>
<li>Format &gt; Cells &gt; Custom &gt; yyyy-mm-dd h:mm:ss</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Created a column called <code>ride_length</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Calculated the length of each ride by subtracting the column <code>started_at</code>
from the column <code>ended_at</code> (example: <code>=D2-C2</code>)</li>
<li>Formatted as <code>TIME</code></li>
<li>Format &gt; Cells &gt; Time &gt; HH:MM:SS (37:30:55)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Created a column called <code>ride_date</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Calculated the date of each ride started using the <code>DATE</code> command
(example: <code>=DATE(YEAR(C2),MONTH(C2),DAY(C2))</code>)</li>
<li>Format &gt; Cells &gt; Date &gt; YYYY-MM-DD</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Created a column called <code>ride_month</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Entered the month of each ride and formatted as number (example: January: <code>=1</code>)</li>
<li>Format &gt; Cells &gt; Number</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Created a column called <code>ride_year</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Entered the year of each ride and formatted as general</li>
<li>Format &gt; Cells &gt; General &gt; YYYY</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Created a column called <code>start_time</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Calculated the start time of each ride using the <code>started_at</code> column</li>
<li>Formatted as <code>TIME</code></li>
<li>Format &gt; Cells &gt; Time &gt; HH:MM:SS (37:30:55)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Created a column called <code>end_time</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Calculated the end time of each ride using the <code>ended_at</code> column</li>
<li>Formatted as <code>TIME</code></li>
<li>Format &gt; Cells &gt; Time &gt; HH:MM:SS (37:30:55)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Created a column called <code>day_of_week</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Calculated the day of the week that each ride started using the <code>WEEKDAY</code>
command (example: <code>=WEEKDAY(C2,1)</code>)</li>
<li>Formatted as a <code>NUMBER</code> with no decimals</li>
<li>Format &gt; Cells &gt; Number (no decimals) &gt; 1,2,3,4,5,6,7</li>
<li>Note: 1 = Sunday and 7 = Saturday</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After making these updates, I saved each .XLS file as a new .CSV file.</p>

<p>Since these datasets are so large, it makes sense to move our analysis to a tool
that is better suited for handling large datasets. I chose to use SQL via <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery">BigQuery</a>.</p>
<p>In order to continue processing the data in BigQuery, I created a bucket in
Google Cloud Storage to upload all 12 files. I then created a project in
BigQuery and uploaded these files as datasets. I&rsquo;ve provided my initial cleaning
and transformation SQL queries here for reference: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->initial_setup_query.sql<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The results from the <code>COUNT DISTINCT</code> query for each table are very interesting.
We can see that the three summer months have the highest trip counts, followed
by alternating spring and fall months before ending with winter months:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h4 id="create-quarterly-tables">Create quarterly tables<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#create-quarterly-tables">#</a></h4>
<p>In order to perform analysis by season, let&rsquo;s combine these tables. We&rsquo;ll
create Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 tables for analysis. We&rsquo;ll have two Q1 tables&ndash; one
for 20221 and one for 2022 &ndash; since we have FEB/MAR data from 2021 and JAN data
from 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li>Table 1) 2021_Q1 -&gt; FEB(02), MAR(03)</li>
<li>Table 2) 2021_Q2 -&gt; APR(04), MAY(05), JUN(06)</li>
<li>Table 3) 2021_Q3 -&gt; JUL(07), AUG(08), SEP(09)</li>
<li>Table 4) 2021_Q4 -&gt; OCT(10), NOV(11), DEC(12)</li>
<li>Table 5) 2022_Q1 -&gt; JAN(01)</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ll first create 2021_Q2 and then repeat for the remaining four tables:</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h4 id="clean-and-transform-day-of-week">Clean and transform day of week<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#clean-and-transform-day-of-week">#</a></h4>
<p>Some additional data cleaning is needed on the new table. First, we&rsquo;ll update
the format for <code>day_of_week</code> from <code>FLOAT</code> to <code>STRING</code>. Then, we&rsquo;ll change the
values from numbers to their corresponding day names (i.e. 1 = Sunday, 7 =
Saturday. We&rsquo;ll start with 2021_Q1 and repeat for the remaining four tables:</p>

<h4 id="delete-old-tables">Delete old tables<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#delete-old-tables">#</a></h4>
<p>Now that we have our tables organized into quarters, we can delete the original
monthly tables from BigQuery. We no longer need the monthly tables since the
data is available in the quarter tables. Also, it costs money to store these
datasets in BigQuery.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll select a few columns from 2021_Q1 to preview in a temporary table. This
will help give us an idea of potential trends and relationships to explore
further:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The above query returned 278,119 rows. That is the number of recorded trips we
have data for in this quarter. Let&rsquo;s dive deeper into those trip totals.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h4 id="total-trips">Total trips<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#total-trips">#</a></h4>
<p>We&rsquo;ll create total columns for overall, annual members and casual riders. We&rsquo;ll
also calculate percentages of overall total for both types:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Of the 278,118 total trips in 2021_Q1, 66% were from annual members while 34% were from casual riders.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h4 id="average-ride-lengths">Average ride lengths<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#average-ride-lengths">#</a></h4>
<p>How does average <code>ride_length</code> differ for these groups?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We can see that casual riders average about 23 more minutes per ride. That seems
like a pretty big difference. What influence are outliers having on these
averages? Let&rsquo;s investigate.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h4 id="max-ride-lengths">Max ride lengths<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#max-ride-lengths">#</a></h4>
<p>We&rsquo;ll look at the maximum values for <code>ride_length</code> to see if anything extreme is
influencing the casual rider average:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As we suspected, the casual riders average <code>ride_length</code> was significantly
impacted by at least one outlier. The longest trip duration for casual riders
was 528 hours, or 22 days. Meanwhile, the longest for annual was about 26 hours.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the top 100 highest <code>ride_length</code> values for casual riders
to confirm there is more than one outlier affecting the average:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h4 id="median-ride-lengths">Median ride lengths<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#median-ride-lengths">#</a></h4>
<p>Since there are more than a few outliers impacting the average, we&rsquo;re going to
use median instead of average. Median will be more accurate for our analysis:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now we see a much closer number, with 18 minutes for casual riders and 10 minutes for annual members.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h4 id="busiest-day-for-rides">Busiest day for rides<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#busiest-day-for-rides">#</a></h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see which day has the most rides for annual members and casual riders:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Unsurprisingly, Saturday is the most popular day for both annual members and casual riders.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h4 id="median-ride-length-per-day">Median ride length per day<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#median-ride-length-per-day">#</a></h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the median ride lengths per day for both annual members and casual
riders. Since Saturday is the most popular overall, do we think it will also
have the highest median ride length?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Very interesting! The median ride length for casual riders on the top five days
(SUN, SAT, MON, TUE, WED) is nearly double the amount for annual members on
their top five days (SAT, SUN, MON, TUE, WED).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h4 id="total-rides-per-day">Total rides per day<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#total-rides-per-day">#</a></h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at total rides per day. We&rsquo;ll create columns for overall total,
annual members and casual riders:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h4 id="start-stations">Start stations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#start-stations">#</a></h4>
<p>Next, we&rsquo;ll look at the most popular start stations for trips. We&rsquo;ll again
include columns for overall, annual member and casual rider totals per start
station:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We can begin to see some interesting patterns in the start station data. It
looks like casual riders and annual members tend to favor different regions
for beginning their trips. By updating the <code>ORDER BY</code> function to sort by
<code>casual DESC</code> and <code>member DESC</code> in two separate queries, we can compare the
top ten start stations for both:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Wow! There is only one start station that cracks the top ten for both lists.<br>
The <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/W+Elm+St+%26+N+Clark+St,+Chicago,+IL+60610/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x880fd34f04679fd7:0xfcb6443483c236c3?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiS7_n4zIr2AhWCJzQIHQS-C9gQ8gF6BAgIEAE">Clark St &amp; Elm St</a>
start station is ranked #1 for annual members and #10 for casual riders. The
casual riders seem to favor stations near the water like <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/S+Lake+Shore+Dr+%26+E+Monroe+St,+Chicago,+IL+60601/@41.8809363,-87.61969,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x880e2b58c766aa85:0x6a3ce76eb41e58c6!8m2!3d41.8809363!4d-87.617496">Lake Shore Dr &amp; Monroe St</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/E+Grand+Ave+%26+N+Streeter+Dr,+Chicago,+IL+60611/@41.8921227,-87.6122317,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x880e2b525e10ee6d:0x1c44bc2bc0376a7!8m2!3d41.8921227!4d-87.610043">Streeter Dr &amp; Grand Ave</a>, while
annual members frequent start stations in the River North neighborhood like

<p>An initial hypothesis for casual riders could be that they tend to favor start
stations near the water and close to tourist attractions because they use bikes
for weekend entertainment. An initial hypothesis for annual members could be
that they tend to favor start stations in downtown, retail areas because they
are using bikes for their work commutes and shopping trips.</p>

<h4 id="summer-vs-winter"><em>Summer vs Winter</em><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#summer-vs-winter">#</a></h4>
<p>The busiest time of year for overall bike trips is Q3&ndash; July, August and
September. This makes sense because these months are mainly summer time. Bike
riding is better suited for warmer weather, which is also why we see a major
drop-off in total rides during the winter months of Q1&ndash; January, February and
March.</p>
<p>Annual members outnumbered casual riders in every quarter except Q3.
Interestingly, the annual members nearly doubled the casual ridership in Q1 and
Q4 while only slightly edging them out in Q2.</p>
<h4 id="median-ride-length"><em>Median ride length</em><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#median-ride-length">#</a></h4>
<p>We learned in the earlier quarterly analysis that the average <code>ride_length</code> for
casual riders was significantly impacted by outliers, so median is a more
accurate measurement for our analysis:<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>We can see that casual riders consistently have longer rides than annual members.</p>
<h4 id="day-of-week"><em>Day of week</em><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#day-of-week">#</a></h4>
<p>Which days of the week have the highest number of rides for casual riders vs
annual members? Let&rsquo;s look at the mode for each quarter and for the full year:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Casual riders were extremely consistent, with <strong>Saturday</strong> revealing itself as
their preferred day of week for each quarter and across the full year. Meanwhile,
the annual members looked to favor the middle of the week for their bike use. The
most popular day for them acrosss the full year was <strong>Wednesday</strong>. Let&rsquo;s see how
the total rides for each day stack up for both groups:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>How about median ride length per day of week for both groups?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A few fascinating insights from the above chart:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>U-shape pattern</strong><br>
Sunday and Saturday are favored by both groups for longer
rides, while ride duration decreases towards the middle of the week before
increasing again on Friday. This results in a u-shape trend for both groups in
the above chart, although it is much more dramatic for casual riders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Range differences</strong><br>
For annual members, difference between their longest day
and their shortest day is 1 minute and 44 seconds. For casual riders,
difference is 4 minute and 57 seconds. That is a 185.58% increase in
difference for casual riders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Annual members: day-to-day consistency</strong><br>
The annual members may have shorter ride lengths when compared to casual
riders, but they are extremely consistent with their bike use day-over-day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Casual riders: weekend warriors</strong><br>
The daily median ride length for casual riders is consistently higher than
that of annual members. The range of their ride length duration varies at a
greater amount than that of annual members. Sundays and Saturdays stand out
as their longest ride days.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bike-type">Bike type<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#bike-type">#</a></h4>
<p>Do members and casual riders have different preferences for bike type? Are
classic bikes more popular than electric bikes?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We can see that classic bikes are favored by both groups. Let&rsquo;s look at the
percentages of bike type use within each group:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Looking at the above, we might ask what exactly is a docked bike and why are only
casual riders using them?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We can now see from the above charts that docked bikes are the culprit for the
outliers affecting our ride length averages from earlier in our analysis. This is
something we should discuss with our team further and address.</p>
<h4 id="start-and-end-station-use">Start and end station use<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#start-and-end-station-use">#</a></h4>
<p>In the Tableau Dashboard I created, which is again available <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, there is a worksheet that
allows the exploration of start and end station use by members, casual riders
and combined overall rides. The snapshot below is from the overall view.
While interacting with the dashboard, we can see that  casual riders have
a higher max than annual members. Annual members have a lower max, but we
can see more colors represented across the member map versus the consistent
coloring across the casual map. This tells us that rides by members are more
distributed across stations while rides by casual riders are more top heavy in
that a huge chunk are happening at the same few stations.</p>
