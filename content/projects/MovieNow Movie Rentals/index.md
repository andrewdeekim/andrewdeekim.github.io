In this project, I analyze historical data from an online movie rental company in order to identify trends in customer preferences, engagement, and sales development. This highlights skills in SQL (PostgreSQL in BigQuery) like aggregate functions, joins, subqueries, OLAP, Common Table Expressions (CTE) and Window Functions. The main tools I use are SQL in Google BigQuery and Tableau. Here are the highlights:

A more in-depth breakdown of the scenario is included below, followed by my full report.  
<br>


### Scenario
MovieNow is considering investing money in new movies. However, it is more expensive for MovieNow to make movies avaiable which were recently produced than older ones.

<br>

***

## ASK: Defining the Business Task  
The following questions will guide the executive stakeholders for decision making:

* Do customers give better ratings to movies which were recently produced than to older ones? Is there a difference across countries?
* What are the most popular genres?
* Who are the most popular actors?


<br>

***

## PREPARE: Data sources

We used historical bike trip data from 5 related tables from the DataCamp assets server. We downloaed the following CSV files:


    1)  actors.csv
    2)  actsin.csv
    3)  customers.csv
    4)  movies.csv
    5)  renting.csv


There are no issues with bias or credibility as all personal identifiable information (PII) has been removed. The data is also credible as it is primary data from the company itself. In other words, it ROCCC's:

* **Reliable and Original**: the data is both reliable and original as it is primary source data.
* **Comprehensive**: the data has all of the relevant fields necessary for our historical analysis.
* **Current**: the data is current as it is from the specific time frame we need in this scenario.
* **Cited**: the data is cited as it is verified as a primary source.
I have saved a folder of the original data and made copies to manipulate for my analysis.

## PROCESS: Data Cleaning & Manipulation

### SQL in Google BigQuery: Initial Set Up  
First, I created a dataset called MovieNow. Then, I uploaded each individual CSV file as a table labeled the same name as the file.

## ANALYZE: 

## Do Later Release Dates Yield Higher Ratings?

### Exploring the head data
{{< github-code-snippets 035ee6bb456fbf63b88987f1b872346b >}}


### Join the data
* `renting`: records of movie rentals with ratings
* `customers`: information about the country of the customer
* `movies`: information about the country of the customer
{{< github-code-snippets df5c5373c1154f0c38a9472d3e996f10 >}}

### Select relevant records
* Use only records of movies with at least 4 ratings
* Use only records of movies rentals since 2018-04-01
{{< github-code-snippets 584d091ff0ef7a73121d0c2ae55e1a96 >}}


### Aggregate the data
Type of Aggregation:
* Count the number of movie rentals
* Count the number of different movies
* Calculate the average rating

Levels of Aggregation:
* Total aggregation
* For movies by year of release
* For movies by year of release separately for the country of the customers
{{< github-code-snippets e9f40c4d8a1f71acd6c1dd49967abe5a >}}

We see the results of the last few summary rows below:
![YOR x Country Results](img/yor_country.png)


> ### INSIGHT: Intuitively, we see there is no clear pattern of movies with a later release having better ratings


## Which are the best rated genres?

{{< github-code-snippets 33d8ef5a314747af8468811bae9eff38 >}}

We see the results of the last few summary rows below:
![YOR x Country Results](img/genre_trends.png)

> ### INSIGHT #1: Action & Adventure was the most popular with an average rating of 8.71, followed by Art House & International with 8.5. 
> ### INSIGHT #2: Drama has a significantly higher number of rentals with a lower average rating of 7.75.

## Who are the most popular actors?

{{< github-code-snippets e41f1f5782b33e8ccadf3d9eb9311143 >}}

We see the results of the last few summary rows below:

> ### INSIGHT: TBD

## SHARE: Supporting Visualizations and Key Findings
Lastly, we export the aggregate data for visualizations in Tableau:
